                                        Project 2: 
What should api do in machine learning, especially in upload data and training:
1.Safety test: ensure that only authorized users can access the API. Maybe use password and username or face id.

2. Create a project: allow users to create a new machine learning project for image classification or object detection.
3. Permission:ensure that each project is associated with a specific user to manage and access control. Maybe only one person( like privacy),or a number of people.

4. Data Management: provide endpoints for users to upload images and corresponding labels or class data for training.Like analyze data which is Implement functionalities to analyze the uploaded data before training, such as data exploration and visualization. And also allow users to add or remove data points from the training dataset as needed.

5. Training Configuration parameters: enable users to specify training parameters such as size, learning rate.

6.Training run and track iterations management: provide training stats upon completion, including metrics like loss, accuracy, etc.

7.Testing and Evaluation: allow users to test a trained model using a new dataset and retrieve evaluation results. Maybe several times of testing is allowed.
